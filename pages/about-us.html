        <h1>Who is One Community Church?!</h1>
        <p>It all started in 2005..</p>

                <h2>2005</h2>
                <p>One Community Church began its journey in October 2005 as Harvest Valley Community Church (HVCC). Our mission was to reach not only the youth of Southern Indiana but also their parents. As our community grew, we found a new home at GRC Elementary School, where we continued to expand our outreach and impact.</p>

                <h2>2011</h2>
                <p>The following summer, we transitioned to Clarksville Elementary School. March 2011 marked a significant new era for HVCC as we welcomed two additional pastors to our staff. Their focus was on addressing the spiritual needs of adults and young adults, ensuring that our growing congregation received comprehensive guidance and support. By fall 2013, we began sharing space with Charity Community Church, a partnership that would lay the groundwork for our future.</p>

                <h2>2014</h2>
                <p>In the spring of 2014, a milestone event occurred: we officially merged with Charity Community Church, forming One Community Church at 1810 Blackiston Mill Rd. in Clarksville. This merger was a testament to God’s abundant blessings and a reflection of our shared vision for a unified community of believers. Our new location became a beacon of faith, fellowship, and service, and we felt immensely grateful for the journey God had led us on.</p>

                  <h2>2024 and Beyond</h2>
                  <p>At One Community Church, we are always planning and preparing for the future with a commitment to fulfilling the Great Commission as outlined in Matthew 28:19-20: "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you." Our mission is to make disciples, one person at a time, continually expanding our reach and deepening our impact. We believe that the best is yet to come, and we are excited to see how God will use us to bring His love and message to our community and beyond.</p>

                <p>My name is Andy Bramer I am the Student and Family Pastor of One Community Church. I have been working with students and their families for over  20 years.  My wife (Ann Marie) and I, have been blessed with 2 awesome sons, Jon and Matt, who are now both married. Jon and his wife, Emili have blessed us with 3 beautiful grandkids (Annabelle, JR and Oliver). Matt and his wife Sandy just blessed us with our 4th grandchild, Everett, and 5th, Hazel. They are also a part of our worship team at OCC.</p>
                
                <p>I came to know Christ when I was 12 years old while attending a local church. I struggled in my walk with Christ while I was in middle and high school. By the time I was realized it was time to quit running. I responded to God’s call into full time youth ministry at the age of 25 and have never looked back. I love working with and ministering to students and their families. One of the ways I am able to do that is through Campus Life & the Fellowship of Christian Athletes that meet weekly at Clarksville Middle & High School. I love the local church and would be glad to talk with you about any questions you might have.</p>

                <p>My name is Daniel Tatum. I am one the associate pastors, besides alternating preaching on Sundays I also lead one of the adult life groups.  I have been married to my lovely wife Wendi since 2004. We have been blessed with two children, Saul and Josie. My walk with God started with the seed my mother planted while dragging me to church and Sunday school every week when I was a kid.</p>
                    
                <p>I gave my life to Christ when I was 13, but I really started building a stronger relationship with him when I met Wendi. We started attending church together and in 2006 our path led us to Harvest Valley (now One Community). We quickly felt like we had found a church family instead of just a church. God has steadily led us to take on more responsibility in the church. Wendi is active in her role in working with the students while I also lead the tech team.  My passion is teaching and I hope to make learning to walk with God a simple and easy to understand concept. God has called me to outreach and I also feel very strong about helping the young men in our church develop into good Christian men as they grow older. We would be glad to see you and your family join us in worshiping and serving God.</p>

                <p id="matt-bio">Hello, my name is Matthew Bramer! I am a husband and a father, and I love to share Jesus to all who will listen. I’m <span id="matt-age"></span> years old, happily married for <span id="matt-wedding-date"></span> years to my wonderful wife, Sandy. Together, we have a delightful <span id="matt-son-age"></span>-year-old son, Everett and an amazing <span id="matt-daughter-age"></span>-year-old daughter, Hazel. I take great pride in balancing my family life, ministry, and career. As I strive to be the best father, husband, and pastor I can be, I am continually focused on personal growth and self-improvement.</p>

                <p>I have recently become one of the associate pastors here at One Community Church. My faith journey has been something that I've always been on. I grew up in church and was baptized when I was 7 years old. Since then, I have been following Christ but refocused my life on Christ and started really studying the Bible towards the beginning of High School. I find the theology and how we got the Bible in our language so fascinating.</p>

                <p>For the past few years or so, I have taken on a lot of responsibility at One Community Church and I've been leading and teaching our Adult Life Group classes on Sundays and Wednesdays. If you visit our church, I might be worshipping God by playing the drums in our worship team, or leading worship singing and playing the guitar with my wife!</p>

                <p>My name is Brion Rector. I am also one of the associate pastors. One of my roles includes  leading our adults.  My wife Hope and I have been married since the summer of 2009.  On May the 16th 2014 we welcomed our daughter Grace Anne Rector into the world. After much prayer, thought and discussion I felt God was calling my wife and I not only to this church but also to this position.</p>
                
                <p>The Lord came into my life in 1998 and life has been a roller coaster ride, full of highs, lows and a few surprise turns ever since. Since God has become the center of my life, I have seen His plan and purpose for my life. I will continue to focus on what God wants in my life and marriage and let God lead me where He needs me to go.  We love it here at One Community Church. I have been involved in various aspects of ministry over the last 12 years in churches primarily located in Southern Indiana. Youth ministry was my primary calling but have recently felt God calling me into the role of adult pastor. I look forward to meeting you and hearing what God is doing in your life.</p>
