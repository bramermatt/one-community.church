                <p>My name is Andy Bramer I am the Student and Family Pastor of One Community Church. I have been working with students and their families for over  20 years.  My wife (Ann Marie) and I, have been blessed with 2 awesome sons, Jon and Matt, who are now both married. Jon and his wife, Emily have blessed us with 3 beautiful grandkids (Annabelle, JR and Oliver. Matt and his wife Sandy just blessed us with our 4th grandchild, Everett, and 5th, Hazel. They are also a part of our worship team at OCC.</p>
                
                <p>I came to know Christ when I was 12 years old while attending a local church. I struggled in my walk with Christ while I was in middle and high school. By the time I was realized it was time to quit running. I responded to God’s call into full time youth ministry at the age of 25 and have never looked back. I love working with and ministering to students and their families. One of the ways I am able to do that is through Campus Life & the Fellowship of Christian Athletes that meet weekly at Clarksville Middle & High School. I love the local church and would be glad to talk with you about any questions you might have.</p>

                <p>My name is Daniel Tatum. I am one the associate pastors, besides alternating preaching on Sundays I also lead one of the adult life groups.  I have been married to my lovely wife Wendi since 2004. We have been blessed with two children, Saul and Josie. My walk with God started with the seed my mother planted while dragging me to church and Sunday school every week when I was a kid.</p>
                    
                <p>I gave my life to Christ when I was 13, but I really started building a stronger relationship with him when I met Wendi. We started attending church together and in 2006 our path led us to Harvest Valley (now One Community). We quickly felt like we had found a church family instead of just a church. God has steadily led us to take on more responsibility in the church. Wendi is active in her role in working with the students while I also lead the tech team.  My passion is teaching and I hope to make learning to walk with God a simple and easy to understand concept. God has called me to outreach and I also feel very strong about helping the young men in our church develop into good Christian men as they grow older. We would be glad to see you and your family join us in worshiping and serving God.</p>

                <p>My name is Brion Rector. I am also one of the associate pastors. One of my roles includes  leading our adults.  My wife Hope and I have been married since the summer of 2009.  On May the 16th 2014 we welcomed our daughter Grace Anne Rector into the world. After much prayer, thought and discussion I felt God was calling my wife and I not only to this church but also to this position.</p>
                
                <p>The Lord came into my life in 1998 and life has been a roller coaster ride, full of highs, lows and a few surprise turns ever since. Since God has become the center of my life, I have seen His plan and purpose for my life. I will continue to focus on what God wants in my life and marriage and let God lead me where He needs me to go.  We love it here at One Community Church. I have been involved in various aspects of ministry over the last 12 years in churches primarily located in Southern Indiana. Youth ministry was my primary calling but have recently felt God calling me into the role of adult pastor. I look forward to meeting you and hearing what God is doing in your life.</p>

        <h1>What We Believe</h1>
        <p>One Community Church Statement of Faith</p>


        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Scriptures</strong> – We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired, and is a perfect treasure of heavenly instruction that is used to guide our lives. It has God for it author, salvation for its end, and truth without any mixture of error. (2 Timothy 3:15-17) (1 Peter 1:25)</li> 


            

            <li><strong>The True God</strong> – We believe that there is one, and only one, living and true God. He is the infinite, intelligent Spirit, the Maker, and Supreme Ruler of heaven and earth. He is indescribably glorious in holiness, and worthy of all possible honor confidence, and love; that in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.(1 Thessalonians 1:9) (John 15:1)</li> 
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>God the Father</strong> - God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe, His creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history according to the purposes of His grace. He is all powerful, all knowing, all loving, and all wise. God is Father in truth to those who become children of God through faith in Jesus Christ. He is fatherly in His attitude toward all men. (Genesis 1:1; 2:7)</li>

                <li><strong>God the Son</strong> - Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation as Jesus Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. Jesus perfectly revealed and did the will of God, taking upon Himself human nature with its demands and necessities and identifying Himself completely with mankind yet without sin. His substitutionary death on the cross He made provision for the redemption of men from sin. He was raised from the dead with a glorified body and appeared to His disciples as the person who was with them before His crucifixion. He ascended into heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God where He is the one Mediator, fully God, fully man, in whose Person is effected the reconciliation between God and man. He will return in power and glory to judge the world and to consummate His redemptive mission. He now dwells in all believers as the living and ever present Lord. (Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 53:1-12) (Matthew 1:18-23) (John 1:1-18)</li>


                <li><strong>God the Holy Spirit</strong> - The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, fully divine. He inspired holy men of old to write the Scriptures. Through illumination He enables men to understand truth. He exalts Christ. He convicts men of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. He calls men to the Savior, and effects regeneration. At the moment of regeneration He baptizes every believer into the Body of Christ. He cultivates Christian character, comforts believers, and bestows the spiritual gifts by which they serve God through His church. He seals the believer unto the day of final redemption. His presence in the Christian is the guarantee that God will bring the believer into the fullness of the stature of Christ. He enlightens and empowers the believer and the church in worship, evangelism and service. (John 4:24; 14:16-17,26; 15:26; 16:7-14) (Acts 1:8)</li>

            </ul>

            <li><strong>The Fall of Man</strong> – We believe that Man was created in holiness, under the law of his Maker, but by voluntary transgression fell from that holy and happy state; in consequence of which all mankind are now sinners, not by constraint but choice. Man is by nature utterly void of the holiness required by the law of God, totally inclined to evil; and therefore under just condemnation to eternal ruin, without defense or excuse. (Genesis 3:1-24) (Romans 5:14, 19)</li>

            <li><strong>Salvation</strong> – Salvation involved the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer. There is no salvation apart from personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord.</li> 
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regeneration, or new birth</strong> - a work of God’s grace whereby believers become a new creation in Christ Jesus. It is a change of heart began by the Holy Spirit through conviction of sin, to which the sinner responds in repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Repentance and faith are inseparable experiences of grace. Repentance is a genuine turning from sin toward God. Faith is the acceptance of Jesus Christ and commitment of the entire personality to Him as Lord and Savior.</li>

                <li><strong>Justification</strong> - God’s act of declaring all sinners who repent and believe in Christ, “not guilty” based upon the principles of His righteousness. Justification brings the believer into a relationship of peace and favor with God.</li>

                <li><strong>Sanctification</strong> - the experience, beginning in regeneration, by which the believer is set apart to God’s purposes, and is enabled to progress toward moral and spiritual maturity through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in him. Growth in grace should continue throughout the new believer’s life.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Glorification</strong> - the culmination of salvation and is the final blessed and abiding state of the redeemed in heaven. </li>

            </ul>

            <li><strong>The Perseverance of Saints</strong> – We believe that only true believers will endure unto the end. Their persevering attachment to Christ distinguishes them from superficial believers and they are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation. (John 6:47, 10:27-28) (Romans 8:1) (Philippians 1:6)</li>
            

            <li><strong>The Church</strong> – We believe that the visible church of Christ is a congregation of baptized believers. (Acts 2:38, 42) (1 Corinthians 12:13, 27)</li>

            <li><strong>Baptism</strong> – We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion in water of a believer, into the name of the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 3:15-17, Matthew 28:19) (Acts 16:30-33) (Romans 6:3-4) (Colossians 2:12) (Acts 16:30-33)</li>
        
            <li><strong>The Lord’ Supper</strong> – The Lord’s Supper, the sacred use of bread and juice, is when the members of the body of Christ commemorate together the dying love of Christ. This is always preceded by our careful self-examination. (Luke 22:19-20) (1 Corinthians 10:16-17) (1 Corinthians 11:23-29)</li>
        

            <li><strong>Of the World to Come</strong> – We believe that the end of the world is approaching. At the last day Christ will descend from heaven and raise the dead from the grave to final retribution. A solemn separation will then take place, the wicked will be adjudged to endless punishment and the righteous to endless joy. This judgment will fix forever the final state of men in heaven or hell, on principles of righteousness. (John 14:3) (Luke 12:40) (Acts 1:11) (1 Corinthians 15:58) (2 Corinthians 5:10) (Jude 1:14)</li>
